    message = '''The provided code represents a rule definition in XData format for an InterSystems production that uses the Ensemble Message Router component ('EnsLib.MsgRouter.RoutingEngine'). The rule definition is part of a rule set within a production ('dc.Demo.Production').
    Let's break down the structure and logic of the code:
    - '<ruleDefinition>' is the root element that encapsulates the entire rule definition.
    - 'alias' attribute specifies an optional alias for the rule definition.
    - 'context' attribute indicates the context in which the rule operates ('EnsLib.MsgRouter.RoutingEngine').
    - 'production' attribute specifies the production to which the rule definition belongs ('dc.Demo.Production').
    - '<ruleSet>' represents a rule set within the production.
    - 'name' attribute indicates the name of the rule set.
    - 'effectiveBegin' and 'effectiveEnd' attributes define optional time boundaries for the rule set's effectiveness.
    - '<rule>' defines a rule within the rule set.
    - 'name' attribute specifies the name of the rule.
    - '<constraint>' is used to define a constraint for the rule.
    - 'name' attribute indicates the name of the constraint.
    - 'value' attribute specifies the value that the constraint should match. In this case, the constraint named 'msgClass' should match the value 'dc.Demo.PostMessage'.
    - '<when>' represents a condition block within the rule. It specifies the condition that needs to be evaluated for the rule to trigger.
    - 'condition' attribute holds the condition to be evaluated. In this case, it checks if the uppercase version of 'Document.Post.Selftext' contains the string 'DOG' or 'CAT'.
    - 'comment' attribute provides an optional comment for the condition.
    - '<assign>' is used to assign values to properties when the condition is met.
    - 'property' attribute specifies the property to be assigned a value.
    - 'value' attribute holds the value to be assigned.
    - '<send>' is used to send a message to a target when the condition is met.
    - 'target' attribute indicates the target component to which the message is sent ('dc.Demo.FileOperation').
    - '<return>' is used to terminate the execution of the rule when it is encountered. This allows the rule engine to proceed to the next rule or perform any necessary cleanup.
    - '<otherwise>' is an optional block that executes when none of the previous conditions match.
    The code defines two conditions: one for when the uppercase version of 'Document.Post.Selftext' contains 'DOG' and another for when it contains 'CAT'. When either condition is met, the corresponding '<assign>' elements update the 'Document.ToEmailAddress' and 'Document.Found' properties. Then, a message is sent to 'dc.Demo.FileOperation'. If none of the conditions match, the '<otherwise>' block is executed, which includes a '<return>' statement, effectively terminating the rule.
    Please note that the provided code snippet is a simplified representation, and the actual behavior and functionality may depend on the surrounding application and the specific implementation of the components and transformations involved.'''
